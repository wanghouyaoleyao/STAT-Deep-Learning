DCGAN_initial.ipynb is the initial model of DCGAN for MNIST dataset(copied from the DCGAN tutorial).

DCGAN_improved.ipynb is the improved model of DCGAN based on the tutorial above.

Slides included description of key functions, visualization results and what I learnt from this homework. 
NOTICE the gif attached in the slides could only be viewed in presentation mode. The slides can't be previewed here on github, I would recommend you download the slides and use presentation mode to view my results or you could preview it on blackboard without the gif.
